# Data Visualization Evaluations: Climate Change Caused by Human Activity
A project on evaluating data visualizations of climate change caused by human activity and replicating visualization

## Evaluations for Visualizations
In the first part of this project, I explored data visualiztions arguing whether climate change is caused by human activity and evaluated the visualizations using the following framework developed from this [article](http://water.engr.psu.edu/wagener/PublicationsPDFs/EMS2011%20Kelleher%20and%20Wagener.pdf).

### Evaluation Framework:
1. **Graph Simplicity** - Create the simplest graph that conveys the information you want to convey
2. **Use the Right Plot** - Consider the type of encoding object and attribute used to create a plot
3. **Plot Focus** - Focus on visualizing patterns or on visualizing details, depending on the purpose of the plot
4. **Meaningful Axis Ranges**
5. **Aggregate Larger Datasets in Meaningful Ways**
6. **Appropriate Color** - Select an appropriate color scheme based on the type of data

### Argument: Climate change _is_ caused by human activity

### Visualization 1. 
Zonal mean atmospheric temperature change from 1890 to 1999 (Â°C per century) as simulated by the PCM model from (a) solar forcing, (b) volcanoes, (c) well mixed greenhouse gases, (d) tropospheric and stratospheric ozone changes, (e) direct sulphate aerosol forcing and (f) the sum of all forcings. Plot is from 1,000 hPa to 10 hPa (shown on left scale) and from 0 km to 30 km (shown on right). Based on Santer et al. (2003a).
